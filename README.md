Flexbox:
As a developer, you cannot expect that the people using your site are
looking at it on a desktop computer. It's just as likely that they'll be
using a phone or a tabletâ€”both of which have different dimensions than 
the typical desktop. The layout that you so carefully constructed to look
beautiful on your desktop might be completely unusable on an iPhone.
Flexbox provides a robust set of tools for developers to solve common
layout problems, including the problem of building for various screen sizes.
When web pages align content properly, the layouts tend to be much easier 
to read.

Media Queries:
Media queries are a CSS feature that allows content to adapt to
different screen sizes, such as mobile and desktop screens. With
a simple media query, you can easily modify a website's appearance 
on different devices.

Progressive Enhancement (Mobile-First Development):
A mobile-first approach that involves designing for the smallest screen first,
then progressively adding features and rearranging the layout to take advantage 
of larger screen sizes
